# Automatic messages to youtube subscribers

Pase this code snippet in the youtube subscribers page (https://www.youtube.com/subscribers) and execute it.

But before that change the message to the one you want to send.

Also change some vars to set how many messages you want to send starting from the last subscribes.

Note that this avoid sending duplicate sending since it stores the id's of the users we previously sent the message
